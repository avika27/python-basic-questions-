        "Answer:- Simple Linear Regression is a fundamental supervised learning algorithm in machine learning used to model the relationship between one independent variable (input feature) and one dependent variable (target output). It assumes a linear relationship between the input and output and represents this relationship using a straight-line equation of the form\n",

        "Answer:- The key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression in machine learning are as follows:\n",
        "First, there must be a linear relationship between the independent variable (X) and the dependent variable (Y), meaning Y changes proportionally with X. Second, the errors (residuals) should be independent of each other, i.e., the error of one observation should not affect another. Third, the model assumes homoscedasticity, which means the variance of errors remains constant across all values of X. Fourth, the residuals should be normally distributed, especially important for statistical inference and confidence intervals. Finally, it assumes no significant outliers, as extreme values can heavily influence the regression line and distort predictions. When these assumptions are reasonably satisfied, Simple Linear Regression provides reliable and accurate results.\n"

It does this by minimizing the sum of the squares of the residuals (errors), where a residual is the difference between the actual value of the dependent variable and the value predicted by the regression line. By squaring the errors, the method ensures that positive and negative errors do not cancel each other out and that larger errors are penalized more heavily.

        "\n",
        "Answer:- In Simple Linear Regression, the coefficient of determination (R²) is interpreted as a measure of how well the independent variable (X) explains the variation in the dependent variable (Y). Its value ranges from 0 to 1, where R² = 0 means the model explains none of the variation in Y, and R² = 1 means the model explains all the variation in Y perfectly. For example, an R² value of 0.75 indicates that 75% of the variability in the dependent variable is explained by the independent variable, while the remaining 25% is due to other factors or random error. Thus, R² helps evaluate the goodness of fit of the regression model, with higher values indicating better explanatory power.\n"

First, there should be a linear relationship between the dependent variable and each independent variable. Second, the errors (residuals) must be independent, meaning the error of one observation does not influence another. Third, the model assumes homoscedasticity, where the variance of residuals remains constant across all levels of the independent variables. Fourth, the residuals should be normally distributed, which is important for reliable statistical inference. Fifth, there should be no multicollinearity among the independent variables, meaning the predictors should not be highly correlated with each other, as this can distort coefficient estimates. Lastly, the model assumes the absence of significant outliers or influential points that could disproportionately affect the regression results."

        "Answer:- Heteroscedasticity refers to a situation in Multiple Linear Regression where the variance of the residuals (errors) is not constant across all values of the independent variables. In other words, the spread of errors increases or decreases as the predicted values change, instead of remaining uniform. This violates the assumption of homoscedasticity. When heteroscedasticity is present, the regression coefficients may still be unbiased, but the standard errors become incorrect, which leads to unreliable t-tests, confidence intervals, and p-values. As a result, the model may give misleading conclusions about the significance of predictors. To address heteroscedasticity, techniques such as data transformation, weighted least squares, or robust standard errors are commonly used."

        "Answer:- A Multiple Linear Regression model with high multicollinearity can be improved by applying several corrective techniques. One common approach is to remove one of the highly correlated independent variables, especially if it adds little new information to the model. Another method is feature selection, where only the most relevant predictors are retained. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) can also be used to transform correlated variables into a smaller set of uncorrelated components. Additionally, regularization techniques such as Ridge Regression or Lasso Regression help reduce the impact of multicollinearity by penalizing large coefficient values. Finally, collecting more data can sometimes reduce multicollinearity effects and improve the stability of the model."

In Label Encoding, each category is assigned a unique numerical value, which is suitable when the categories have no inherent order but is mainly used for tree-based models. One-Hot Encoding converts each category into a separate binary (0 or 1) feature, making it the most widely used method for linear and multiple regression models because it avoids introducing artificial order among categories. Ordinal Encoding is applied when categories have a meaningful order (such as low, medium, high), assigning increasing numerical values accordingly. In some cases, Binary Encoding or Target Encoding is also used to handle high-cardinality categorical variables efficiently. These techniques allow regression models to process categorical data in a numerical and meaningful way."

        "Answer:-  The interpretation of the intercept differs slightly between Simple Linear Regression and Multiple Linear Regression due to the number of independent variables involved. In Simple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when the single independent variable is zero, making it relatively straightforward to interpret if X = 0 is meaningful. In Multiple Linear Regression, the intercept represents the expected value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are zero simultaneously. This condition is often unrealistic or outside the range of the data, which can make the intercept less meaningful in practical terms. As a result, while the intercept still serves an important mathematical role in both models, its real-world interpretation is usually clearer in simple linear regression than in multiple linear regression."

It shows how much the predicted value of the output will increase or decrease for a one-unit change in the input, while keeping other variables constant in the case of multiple regression. A positive slope indicates a direct relationship, whereas a negative slope indicates an inverse relationship. The magnitude of the slope reflects the strength of the effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. Since predictions in regression models are computed using the slope, it directly determines how sensitive the predicted outcomes are to changes in the input variables, making it a crucial component for both interpretation and forecasting.\n"

        "Answer:- The intercept in a regression model provides context by representing the baseline or starting value of the dependent variable when all independent variables are set to zero. It helps anchor the regression line and gives a reference point from which the effect of the independent variables is measured. While the intercept may not always have a direct real-world interpretation—especially when zero values of the predictors are unrealistic—it still plays an important role in defining the overall relationship between variables. By establishing this baseline, the intercept allows the slopes of the model to be interpreted as changes relative to a fixed starting point, helping clarify how the dependent variable responds as the independent variables vary."

        "Answer:- Using R² as the sole measure of model performance has several important limitations. First, R² only indicates how much variance in the dependent variable is explained by the model, but it does not tell whether the model is appropriate or correct. A high R² can occur even when the model violates key regression assumptions or is overfitting the data. Second, R² always increases or stays the same when more independent variables are added, even if those variables are irrelevant, which can give a false impression of improved model quality. Third, R² does not reflect the predictive accuracy of the model on new or unseen data. It also provides no information about bias, error magnitude, or causality. Therefore, R² should be used alongside other metrics such as Adjusted R², RMSE, MAE, residual analysis, and validation techniques to properly evaluate a regression model."

        "Answer:- A large standard error for a regression coefficient indicates that the estimated value of the coefficient is imprecise and unstable. It means there is a high level of uncertainty about the true effect of the independent variable on the dependent variable. This often occurs due to multicollinearity, small sample size, high variability in the data, or model misspecification. As a result, the coefficient may not be statistically significant, even if its estimated value appears large, leading to wide confidence intervals and unreliable hypothesis tests. Therefore, a large standard error suggests that conclusions drawn about the importance or impact of that predictor should be treated with caution.\n"

If the residuals show a systematic pattern—such as a fan shape, cone shape, or increasing/decreasing spread rather than a random and constant spread around zero—it indicates the presence of heteroscedasticity. Addressing heteroscedasticity is important because it violates a key assumption of regression analysis, leading to biased standard errors and therefore unreliable confidence intervals, hypothesis tests, and p-values. While the coefficient estimates may remain unbiased, ignoring heteroscedasticity can result in incorrect conclusions about the significance of predictors, making it essential to detect and correct for it using appropriate methods."

R² always increases when more predictors are added, even if they do not improve the model meaningfully, whereas Adjusted R² penalizes the inclusion of irrelevant or redundant variables. A low Adjusted R² therefore suggests overfitting, where the model is unnecessarily complex and includes predictors that add noise rather than real explanatory power. This indicates that the model could be improved by removing unimportant variables or applying feature selection techniques.\n"

Scaling ensures that all variables contribute fairly to the estimation of coefficients, especially when their magnitudes differ significantly (for example, income in thousands versus age in years). While scaling does not change the predictive power of a basic linear regression model, it becomes crucial when using regularization techniques like Ridge or Lasso regression, where unscaled variables can dominate the penalty term. Additionally, scaling improves numerical stability, helps in faster convergence of optimization algorithms, and makes the coefficients easier to compare, leading to a more reliable and interpretable model.\n",

It is especially useful when data shows a curved or bending trend, such as increasing at a decreasing rate or having peaks and valleys. Polynomial regression is commonly applied in scenarios like growth modeling, trend analysis, learning curves, and physical or biological processes where the effect of the input changes at different levels. It is chosen when simple or multiple linear regression underfits the data, but the relationship can still be well-approximated by a smooth polynomial function without requiring complex non-linear models."

        "\n",
        "Answer:- Polynomial regression has several limitations despite its ability to model non-linear relationships. First, it is highly prone to overfitting, especially when a high-degree polynomial is used, as the model may fit noise rather than the true underlying pattern. Second, choosing the appropriate degree of the polynomial is challenging—too low leads to underfitting, while too high reduces generalization. Third, polynomial regression can become numerically unstable, particularly for large values of the independent variable, leading to extreme coefficient values. Fourth, as the degree increases, the model becomes harder to interpret, reducing its practical usefulness. Lastly, polynomial regression often performs poorly for extrapolation, as predictions outside the range of the training data can be unrealistic or extreme."

        "\n",
        "Answer:- When selecting the degree of a polynomial, model fit can be evaluated using several complementary methods. Commonly, error-based metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) are used to measure how closely the model’s predictions match the actual values, with lower values indicating better fit. Cross-validation, especially k-fold cross-validation, is crucial to assess how well different polynomial degrees generalize to unseen data and to avoid overfitting. R² and Adjusted R² are also useful, as Adjusted R² penalizes unnecessary model complexity. Additionally, residual analysis helps check whether errors are randomly distributed, indicating an appropriate model. Together, these methods help balance model accuracy and complexity when choosing the optimal polynomial degree.\n"

        "\n",
        "Answer:- Visualization is important in polynomial regression because it helps in understanding, diagnosing, and validating the model’s behavior. By plotting the data points along with the fitted polynomial curve, we can clearly see whether the model captures the non-linear pattern in the data or if it is underfitting or overfitting. Visualization also makes it easier to choose an appropriate degree of the polynomial, as higher degrees may show unnecessary oscillations that indicate overfitting. Additionally, residual plots help identify issues such as heteroscedasticity, outliers, or systematic errors. Overall, visualization provides intuitive insight into model performance that numerical metrics alone may not fully reveal."
