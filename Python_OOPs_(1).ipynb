It is defined inside the class but outside any methods, meaning there is only one copy of it that all instances share. Any change made to a class variable affects all objects of that class.

The __str__ method returns a clean, readable, and user-friendly string, mainly used when printing the object so the output looks understandable to normal users. On the other hand, the __repr__ method returns a detailed and developer-friendly string which is useful for debugging, and it ideally shows how to recreate the object.

It allows you to access the parent class’s features without directly naming it, which makes the code cleaner and helps in multiple inheritance.
